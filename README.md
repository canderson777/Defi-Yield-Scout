- **Yield Opportunities**: Real-time analysis of APY/APR across protocols
- **Risk Assessment**: Smart contract audits, TVL analysis, and protocol health
- **Gas Optimization**: Cost-benefit analysis for different strategies
- **Portfolio Management**: Track and optimize yield farming positions

## Features

- 🔍 **Multi-Protocol Analysis**: Supports major DeFi protocols (Uniswap, Aave, Compound, etc.)
- 📊 **Real-time Data**: Live APY/APR tracking with historical analysis
- 🛡️ **Risk Scoring**: Comprehensive risk assessment for each opportunity
- 💰 **Gas Optimization**: Cost analysis and optimization recommendations
- 📈 **Portfolio Tracking**: Monitor and manage yield farming positions
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Insights**: Intelligent recommendations based on market conditions

## Architecture

Built on Sentient's ROMA framework with specialized agents:

- **Data Collection Agent**: Gathers real-time data from DeFi protocols
